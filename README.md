# GifTastic
This  project incorporates an external API to generate images based on button clicks.  The buttons are each assigned a "mood" and when clicked, images depicting that mood will appear (max 10 images per click). The user may enter a mood in the text box and upon clicking the "I'm Feeling..." button, a new mood button will be generated.  When the new button (and any subsequent buttons) is clicked, images with the corresponding mood will appear.
